            <h2 style="color: #433495;">Bench Press</h2>
            <div class= "description">
                <ol type = "1">
                    <li>Lie flat on your back on a bench.</li>
                    <li>Grip the bar with hands just wider than shoulder-width apart, so when you’re at the bottom of your move your hands are directly above your elbows. This allows for maximum force generation.</li>
                    <li>Bring the bar slowly down to your chest as you breathe in.</li>
                    <li>Push up as you breathe out, gripping the bar hard and watching a spot on the ceiling rather than the bar, so you can ensure it travels the same path every time.</li>
                </ol>
            </div>
            <h2 style="color: #433495;">Shoulder Press</h2>
            <div class="description">
                <ol type = "1">
                    <li>Stand with feet shoulder-width apart and hold the dumbbells at shoulder height with your elbows at a 90-degree angle.</li>
                    <li>Slowly lift the dumbbells above your head without fully straightening your arms. Pause at the top.</li>
                    <li>Slowly return to the start position.</li>
                </ol>

            <h2 style="color: #433495;">Bicep Curls</h2>
            <div class="description">
                <ol type = "1">
                    <li>Begin standing tall with your feet about hip-width apart. Keep your abdominal muscles engaged.</li>
                    <li>Hold one dumbbell in each hand. Let your arms relax down at the sides of your body with palms facing forward.</li>
                    <li>Keeping your upper arms stable and shoulders relaxed, bend at the elbow and lift the weights so that the dumbbells approach your shoulders. Your elbows should stay tucked in close to your ribs. Exhale while lifting.</li>
                    <li>Lower the weights to the starting position.</li>
                    <li>Do 8–10 curls, then rest and do one or two more sets.</li>
                </ol>
            </div>
            
            <h2 style="color: #433495;">Tricep Extensions</h2>
            <div class="description">
                <ol type ="1">
                    <li>Lift the dumbbell directly overhead. Be sure that the head stays aligned over the chest, the core remains engaged, and the shoulders relaxed.</li>
                    <li>Extend both arms fully, then exhale and slowly lower the weight down, bringing the weight behind the head by bending at the elbows. Be sure the chest stays aligned over the hips, and the back does not arch.</li>
                    <li>Inhale and reverse the movement once you reach a 90-degree bend at the elbow or slightly further, lifting the weight back to the starting position. The weight should not touch the back of the head when it is in its lowest position.</li>
