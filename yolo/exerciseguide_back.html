            <h2 style="color: #433495;">Tricep Press Downs</h2>
            <div class="description">
                <ol type = "1">
                    <li>Face the triceps pushdown cable machine and grasp the horizontal cable bar or rope attachment (depending on the machine your gym has) with an overhand grip.1﻿ Adjust the bar or rope grips to about chest level.</li>
                    <li>Start by bracing your abdominals.</li>
                    <li>Tuck your elbows in at your sides and position your feet slightly apart.</li>
                    <li>Inhale. Push down until your elbows are fully extended but not yet in the straight, locked position. Keep your elbows close to your body and bend your knees slightly on the pushdown. Resist bending forward. Try to keep your back as straight as possible as you push down.</li>
                    <li>As you exhale, return to the starting point using a controlled movement. Try not to crash the weights.</li>
                </ol>
            </div>
            
            <h2 style="color: #433495;">Bent Over Rows</h2>
            <div class="description">
                <ol type = "1">
                    <li>Grab a set of dumbbells, bend your torso forward and keep your knees slightly bent.</li>
                    <li>Pull the dumbbells toward your waistline, while squeezing your shoulder blades.</li>
                    <li>Slowly lower the weights to the starting position. A 1-second pull, 1-second pause, 2 second down count is ideal.</li>
                    <li>Repeat.</li>
                </ol>
            </div>
            
            <h2 style="color: #433495;">Lateral Raises</h2>
            <div class="description">
                <ol type ="1">
                    <li>Stand tall, a dumbbell in each hand. Arms are at your sides, palms facing in. Position your feet roughly hip-distance apart. Check your posture—roll your shoulders back, engage your core, and look straight ahead.</li>
                    <li>Raise your arms simultaneously just a couple inches out to each side and pause. This momentary pause should help ensure you disengage your trapezius muscle from the movement, targeting the deltoids as intended.</li>
                    <li>Lift the dumbbells up and out to each side, keeping your arms almost completely straight, stopping when your elbows reach shoulder-height and your body is forming a "T" shape. Breathe in as you lift.</li>
                    <li>Pause and hold for a second at the top of the movement.</li>
                    <li>Lower the weights slowly (take about twice as long to lower the weights as you took to lift them), bringing your arms back to your sides. Breathe out as you lower the dumbbells.</li>
                </ol>
