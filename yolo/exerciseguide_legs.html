            <h2 style="color: #433495;">Split Squats</h2>
            <div class="description">
                <ol type = "1">
                    <li>From a standing position, take a long step forwards as if performing a lunge.</li>
                    <li>The heel of your back foot should be raised. Keeping your torso straight, lower slowly until your back knee almost touches the floor, then push back up.</li>
                    <li>Complete all your reps on one leg, then switch to the other.</li>
                    <li>Keep your knees in line with your toes, especially on the front leg, and don’t let the front knee stray past your foot as you lower.</li>
                </ol>

            <h2 style="color: #433495;">Squats</h2>
            <div class="description">
                <ol type = "1">
                    <li>Stand with feet a little wider than hip width, toes facing front.</li>
                    <li>Drive your hips back—bending at the knees and ankles and pressing your knees slightly open</li>
                    <li>Sit into a squat position while still keeping your heels and toes on the ground, chest up and shoulders back.</li>
                    <li>Strive to eventually reach parallel, meaning knees are bent to a 90-degree angle.</li>
                    <li>Press into your heels and straighten legs to return to a standing upright position.</li>
                </ol>

            <h2 style="color: #433495;">Leg Press</h2>
            <div class="description">
                <ol type ="1">
                    <li>Sit down on a leg press machine and place your legs on the platform in front of you. Your feet should be positioned approximately a foot to one and half feet apart.</li>
                    <li>Lower the safety bars holding the platform in place. Press the platform all the way up until your legs are fully extended, without locking your knees. This is the starting position.</li>
                    <li>As you inhale, slowly lower the platform until your upper and lower legs make a 90-degree angle.</li>
                    <li>Push with the heels of your feet and use your quadriceps to go back to the starting position. Exhale as you do so.</li>
                    <li>Repeat for the number of reps in your set. Make sure that the safety pins are locked properly once you have finished.</li>
                </ol>
            </div>

            <h2 style="color: #433495;">Reverse Lunges</h2>
            <div class="description">
                <ol type ="1">
                    <li>Start by standing straight and bracing your core muscles.</li>
                    <li>Then take a giant step backwards with your left foot. Bend your right knee until it’s at 90°, and lower your left knee until it is also bent at a right angle.</li>
                    <li>Then push back up and return to the starting position.</li>
